This store may have been introduced to assist the garbage collector, but\nas of Java SE 6.0, this is no longer needed or useful.\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_SHADOWS_FIELD\">DLS: Dead store to local variable that shadows field (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_SHADOWS_FIELD)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p>\nThis instruction assigns a value to a local variable,\nbut the value is not read or used in any subsequent instruction.\nOften, this indicates an error, because the value computed is never\nused. There is a field with the same name as the local variable. Did you\nmean to assign to that variable instead?\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"DMI_HARDCODED_ABSOLUTE_FILENAME\">DMI: Code contains a hard coded reference to an absolute pathname (DMI_HARDCODED_ABSOLUTE_FILENAME)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p>This code constructs a File object using a hard coded to an absolute pathname\n(e.g., <code>new File(\"/home/dannyc/workspace/j2ee/src/share/com/sun/enterprise/deployment\");</code>\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"DMI_NONSERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_WRITTEN\">DMI: Non serializable object written to ObjectOutput (DMI_NONSERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_WRITTEN)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p>\nThis code seems to be passing a non-serializable object to the ObjectOutput.writeObject method.\nIf the object is, indeed, non-serializable, an error will result.\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"DMI_USELESS_SUBSTRING\">DMI: Invocation of substring(0), which returns the original value (DMI_USELESS_SUBSTRING)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p>\nThis code invokes substring(0) on a String, which returns the original value.\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"DMI_THREAD_PASSED_WHERE_RUNNABLE_EXPECTED\">Dm: Thread passed where Runnable expected (DMI_THREAD_PASSED_WHERE_RUNNABLE_EXPECTED)</a></h3>\n\n\n  <p> A Thread object is passed as a parameter to a method where\na Runnable is expected. This is rather unusual, and may indicate a logic error\nor cause unexpected behavior.\n   </p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"EQ_DOESNT_OVERRIDE_EQUALS\">Eq: Class doesn't override equals in superclass (EQ_DOESNT_OVERRIDE_EQUALS)</a></h3>\n\n\n  <p> This class extends a class that defines an equals method and adds fields, but doesn't\ndefine an equals method itself. Thus, equality on instances of this class will\nignore the identity of the subclass and the added fields. Be sure this is what is intended,\nand that you don't need to override the equals method. Even if you don't need to override\nthe equals method, consider overriding it anyway to document the fact\nthat the equals method for the subclass just return the result of\ninvoking super.equals(o).\n  </p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"EQ_UNUSUAL\">Eq: Unusual equals method  (EQ_UNUSUAL)</a></h3>\n\n\n  <p> This class doesn't do any of the patterns we recognize for checking that the type of the argument\nis compatible with the type of the <code>this</code> object. There might not be anything wrong with\nthis code, but it is worth reviewing.\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"FE_FLOATING_POINT_EQUALITY\">FE: Test for floating point equality (FE_FLOATING_POINT_EQUALITY)</a></h3>\n\n   \n    <p>\n    This operation compares two floating point values for equality.\n    Because floating point calculations may involve rounding,\n   calculated float and double values may not be accurate.\n    For values that must be precise, such as monetary values,\n   consider using a fixed-precision type such as BigDecimal.\n    For values that need not be precise, consider comparing for equality\n    within some range, for example:\n    <code>if ( Math.abs(x - y) &lt; .0000001 )</code>.\n   See the Java Language Specification, section 4.2.4.\n    </p>\n    \n     \n<h3><a name=\"VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION_TO_BOOLEAN\">FS: Non-Boolean argument formatted using %b format specifier (VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION_TO_BOOLEAN)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p>\nAn argument not of type Boolean is being formatted with a %b format specifier. This won't throw an\nexception; instead, it will print true for any non-null value, and false for null.\nThis feature of format strings is strange, and may not be what you intended.\n</p>\n\n     \n<h3><a name=\"IA_AMBIGUOUS_INVOCATION_OF_INHERITED_OR_OUTER_METHOD\">IA: Potentially ambiguous invocation of either an inherited or outer method (IA_AMBIGUOUS_INVOCATION_OF_INHERITED_OR_OUTER_METHOD)</a></h3>\n\n\n  <p>\nAn inner class is invoking a method that could be resolved to either a inherited method or a method defined in an outer class.\nFor example, you invoke <code>foo(17)</code>, which is defined in both a superclass and in an outer method.\nBy the Java semantics,\nit will be resolved to invoke the inherited method, but this may not be want\nyou intend.\n</p>\n<p>If you really intend to invoke the inherited method,\ninvoke it by invoking the method on super (e.g., invoke super.foo(17)), and\nthus it will be clear to other readers of your code and to FindBugs\nthat you want to invoke the inherited method, not the method in the outer class.\n</p>\n<p>If you call <code>this.foo(17)</code>, then the inherited method will be invoked. However, since FindBugs only looks at\nclassfiles, it\ncan't tell the difference between an invocation of <code>this.foo(17)</code> and <code>foo(17)</code>, it will still\ncomplain about a potential ambiguous invocation.\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"IC_INIT_CIRCULARITY\">IC: Initialization circularity (IC_INIT_CIRCULARITY)</a></h3>\n\n\n  <p> A circularity was detected in the static initializers of the two\n  classes referenced by the bug instance.&nbsp; Many kinds of unexpected\n  behavior may arise from such circularity.</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"ICAST_IDIV_CAST_TO_DOUBLE\">ICAST: Integral division result cast to double or float (ICAST_IDIV_CAST_TO_DOUBLE)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p>\nThis code casts the result of an integral division (e.g., int or long division)\noperation to double or\nfloat.\nDoing division on integers truncates the result\nto the integer value closest to zero.  The fact that the result\nwas cast to double suggests that this precision should have been retained.\nWhat was probably meant was to cast one or both of the operands to\ndouble <em>before</em> performing the division.  Here is an example:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>int x = 2;\nint y = 5;\n// Wrong: yields result 0.0\ndouble value1 =  x / y;\n\n// Right: yields result 0.4\ndouble value2 =  x / (double) y;\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"ICAST_INTEGER_MULTIPLY_CAST_TO_LONG\">ICAST: Result of integer multiplication cast to long (ICAST_INTEGER_MULTIPLY_CAST_TO_LONG)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p>\nThis code performs integer multiply and then converts the result to a long,\nas in:</p>\n<pre>    long convertDaysToMilliseconds(int days) { return 1000*3600*24*days; }\n</pre>\n<p>\nIf the multiplication is done using long arithmetic, you can avoid\nthe possibility that the result will overflow. For example, you\ncould fix the above code to:</p>\n<pre>    long convertDaysToMilliseconds(int days) { return 1000L*3600*24*days; }\n</pre>\nor\n<pre>    static final long MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY = 24L*3600*1000;\n    long convertDaysToMilliseconds(int days) { return days * MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY; }\n</pre>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"IM_AVERAGE_COMPUTATION_COULD_OVERFLOW\">IM: Computation of average could overflow (IM_AVERAGE_COMPUTATION_COULD_OVERFLOW)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p>The code computes the average of two integers using either division or signed right shift,\nand then uses the result as the index of an array.\nIf the values being averaged are very large, this can overflow (resulting in the computation\nof a negative average).  Assuming that the result is intended to be nonnegative, you\ncan use an unsigned right shift instead. In other words, rather that using <code>(low+high)/2</code>,\nuse <code>(low+high) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1</code>\n</p>\n<p>This bug exists in many earlier implementations of binary search and merge sort.\nMartin Buchholz <a href=\"http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6412541\">found and fixed it</a>\nin the JDK libraries, and Joshua Bloch\n<a href=\"http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html\">widely\npublicized the bug pattern</a>.\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"IM_BAD_CHECK_FOR_ODD\">IM: Check for oddness that won't work for negative numbers  (IM_BAD_CHECK_FOR_ODD)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p>\nThe code uses x % 2 == 1 to check to see if a value is odd, but this won't work\nfor negative numbers (e.g., (-5) % 2 == -1). If this code is intending to check\nfor oddness, consider using x &amp; 1 == 1, or x % 2 != 0.\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"INT_BAD_REM_BY_1\">INT: Integer remainder modulo 1 (INT_BAD_REM_BY_1)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p> Any expression (exp % 1) is guaranteed to always return zero.\nDid you mean (exp &amp; 1) or (exp % 2) instead?\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"INT_VACUOUS_BIT_OPERATION\">INT: Vacuous bit mask operation on integer value (INT_VACUOUS_BIT_OPERATION)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p> This is an integer bit operation (and, or, or exclusive or) that doesn't do any useful work\n(e.g., <code>v &amp; 0xffffffff</code>).\n\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"INT_VACUOUS_COMPARISON\">INT: Vacuous comparison of integer value (INT_VACUOUS_COMPARISON)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p> There is an integer comparison that always returns\nthe same value (e.g., x &lt;= Integer.MAX_VALUE).\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"MTIA_SUSPECT_SERVLET_INSTANCE_FIELD\">MTIA: Class extends Servlet class and uses instance variables (MTIA_SUSPECT_SERVLET_INSTANCE_FIELD)</a></h3>\n\n   \n    <p>\n    This class extends from a Servlet class, and uses an instance member variable. Since only\n    one instance of a Servlet class is created by the J2EE framework, and used in a\n    multithreaded way, this paradigm is highly discouraged and most likely problematic.

Since only\n    one instance of a struts Action class is created by the Struts framework, and used in a\n    multithreaded way, this paradigm is highly discouraged and most likely problematic.

Although this is valid, it might be a mistake (perhaps you\nintended to refer to a different variable, or perhaps the earlier check to see if the\nvariable is null should have been a check to see if it was non-null).\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"NP_METHOD_PARAMETER_TIGHTENS_ANNOTATION\">NP: Method tightens nullness annotation on parameter (NP_METHOD_PARAMETER_TIGHTENS_ANNOTATION)</a></h3>\n\n        <p>\n        A method should always implement the contract of a method it overrides. Thus, if a method takes a parameter\n    that is marked as @Nullable, you shouldn't override that method in a subclass with a method where that parameter is @Nonnull.\n    Doing so violates the contract that the method should handle a null parameter.\n        </p>\n      \n<h3><a name=\"NP_METHOD_RETURN_RELAXING_ANNOTATION\">NP: Method relaxes nullness annotation on return value (NP_METHOD_RETURN_RELAXING_ANNOTATION)</a></h3>\n\n        <p>\n        A method should always implement the contract of a method it overrides.

It is a common bug pattern to\n  say try { ... } catch (Exception e) { something } as a shorthand for catching a number of types of exception\n  each of whose catch blocks is identical, but this construct also accidentally catches RuntimeException as well,\n  masking potential bugs.\n  </p>\n  <p>A better approach is to either explicitly catch the specific exceptions that are thrown,\n  or to explicitly catch RuntimeException exception, rethrow it, and then catch all non-Runtime Exceptions, as shown below:</p>\n  <pre>  try {\n    ...\n  } catch (RuntimeException e) {\n    throw e;\n  } catch (Exception e) {\n    ... deal with all non-runtime exceptions ...\n  }</pre>\n  \n     \n<h3><a name=\"RI_REDUNDANT_INTERFACES\">RI: Class implements same interface as superclass (RI_REDUNDANT_INTERFACES)</a></h3>\n\n   \n    <p>\n    This class declares that it implements an interface that is also implemented by a superclass.\n    This is redundant because once a superclass implements an interface, all subclasses by default also\n    implement this interface.
