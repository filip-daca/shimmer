For example,\nsynchronizing on an <code>AtomicBoolean</code> will not prevent other threads\nfrom modifying the  <code>AtomicBoolean</code>.</p>\n<p>Such code may be correct, but should be carefully reviewed and documented,\nand may confuse people who have to maintain the code at a later date.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3><a name=\"JML_JSR166_CALLING_WAIT_RATHER_THAN_AWAIT\">JLM: Using monitor style wait methods on util.concurrent abstraction (JML_JSR166_CALLING_WAIT_RATHER_THAN_AWAIT)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p> This method calls\n<code>wait()</code>,\n<code>notify()</code> or\n<code>notifyAll()()</code>\non an object that also provides an\n<code>await()</code>,\n<code>signal()</code>,\n<code>signalAll()</code> method (such as util.concurrent Condition objects).\nThis probably isn't what you want, and even if you do want it, you should consider changing\nyour design, as other developers will find it exceptionally confusing.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3><a name=\"LI_LAZY_INIT_STATIC\">LI: Incorrect lazy initialization of static field (LI_LAZY_INIT_STATIC)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p> This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a non-volatile static field.\nBecause the compiler or processor may reorder instructions,\nthreads are not guaranteed to see a completely initialized object,\n<em>if the method can be called by multiple threads</em>.\nYou can make the field volatile to correct the problem.\nFor more information, see the\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/\">Java Memory Model web site</a>.\n</p>\n\n    \n<h3><a name=\"LI_LAZY_INIT_UPDATE_STATIC\">LI: Incorrect lazy initialization and update of static field (LI_LAZY_INIT_UPDATE_STATIC)</a></h3>\n\n\n<p> This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a static field.\nAfter the field is set, the object stored into that location is further updated or accessed.\nThe setting of the field is visible to other threads as soon as it is set.

But guarding a field\ngets a lock on the referenced object, not on the field. This may not\nprovide the mutual exclusion you need, and other threads might\nbe obtaining locks on the referenced objects (for other purposes).
